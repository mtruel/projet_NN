Neural Network N°2
==================

----------------------------
 Goal of the neural network
----------------------------

This Neural Network (NN2) aims at guessing the coordinates of the inner nodes. 
The algorithm takes as input the number of inner nodes approximated by the first neural network,
and the coordinates of the nodes of a cartesian grid that are inside the polygon.


---------------------
 Database generation
---------------------

We need to generate the same polygons as the first neural network, get the number of inner nodes 
generated by gmsh, but also their coordinates. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Grid Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This second neural network works thanks to a cartesian grid of fixed scale.
The size of the elements of the grid is arbitrary, 
but should logically be smaller than the size of the smallest edge.

.. code-block:: python

    Gscale_factor = 0.1
    Gscale = Gscale_factor * ls  # size of mesh grid

The grid should first contain the entire polygon, 
thus its side size should be greater than the maximum distance between two points 
on the horizontal and vertical axis.
However, the polygon is scaled and is always contained in the unit circle. 
It is then more conveignant and faster to keep the unit size 
instead of optimizing a few hundredths every iteration.

The grid generation is made by the ``create_grid()`` function.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Inside nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the grid is generated, we need to find the coordinates of the grid nodes 
that are inside the polygon. 
The function ``is_in_contour`` does it by using the Even-odd rule. 
The algorithm is taken from `this python code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even%E2%80%93odd_rule#cite_note-3>`_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Scores of nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each grid node now has to be graded with a score defined as 
the distance to the closest mesh node. The function ``score_of_node`` gives the score of a given node 
and ``calculate_score_array`` the list of scores for each point of the grid inside the polygon.

  Example of scores repartition for polygons of 7 nodes. We can see the 4 nodes placed by gmsh.  

NN2 will have to return this list of scores on its own once trained given 
the coordinates of the grid points inside the polygon and the number of inner nodes.

---------------------
 Neural Network
---------------------

First, all the grid nodes inside the polygon are given to the network.
Later, we could split the grid in multiple parts to give more data to the network.

------------------------
 Final node positioning
------------------------

Once the list of scores is guessed by the NN2, we have to guess the coordinates of the mesh nodes, and 
make an interpolation to place the nodes more precisely.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Find the minimums
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A solution to find the nodes is made by the following algorithm : 

* Find the current node with the minimum score and mark it
* Remove all the nodes within a given radius around the marked node
* Find the new minimum and repeat

If the radius is large enough, the new minimum should be in a 
different position, and the operation can be repeated as much as there 
are inner nodes.
